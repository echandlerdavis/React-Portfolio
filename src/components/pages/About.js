      <p>
      I am currently a remote Researcher and Data Specialist for a small law firm, but am looking to enter a career in tech development. 
      I am interested in music, visual art, racial justice, trans rights, and psychology. I look forward to using my skills to contribute to companies that match my values and are working toward a more equitable world.
